# EasyMark

EasyMark is an offline image annotation software developed by students of the Federal University of Santa Maria, at the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Center (NADIA). Programmed in Python and utilizing the Tkinter UI framework, EasyMark allows the user to annotate large batches of images and export these annotations in a proper format for AI object detection training. The tool contains manual, semi-automatic and fully automatic annotation features depending on the user's needs.
